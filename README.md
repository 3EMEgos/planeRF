# planeRF
Python code repository for an interactive web app that calculates and plots $S_E$ and $S_H$ of a RF plane wave that is incident on a PEC or real ground.

The `Dash##` and `Anvil##` folders contain progressive iterations of Dash and Anvil web apps.

The features of the planeRF web app include:
+ Calculate both $S_E=|E|²/377$ and $S_H=377|H|²$
+ Calculate for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes of the incident plane wave
+
